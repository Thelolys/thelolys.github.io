            OVERVIEW
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Huracán Performante has reworked the concept of super sports cars and taken the notion of performance to levels never seen before. The vehicle has been re-engineered in its entirety, as regards its weight, engine power, chassis and above all by introducing an innovative system of active aerodynamics: ALA. The use of the awarded Forged Composites®, a shapable forged carbon fiber material patented by Automobili Lamborghini, is a real nice touch and it contributes to make the vehicle even lighter in weight. Besides its extraordinary technological properties, it also conveys a new idea of beauty.

            EMOTION
        </h1>
        <p>
            Just hop in and drive to understand that the Performante is different from all the other Huracán models, as it was designed with one thing in mind: to be the fastest. The car has been completely updated, improving the engine, increasing the performance of the steering and suspension, using ultra-lightweight materials, and introducing an innovative active aerodynamic system in order to improve the performance level and driving experience.

            EXTERIOR DESIGN
        </h1>
        <p>
            All the new features of the Huracán Performante express performance. The front and rear spoilers, made entirely of Forged Composites®, enable the aerodynamics to be actively exploited to achieve maximum performance by increasing or decreasing the downforce as required. The new, even lighter wheel rims hold the new Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres, providing incredible grip.

        </h1>
            <p>
                The interior fully reflects the character of the Huracán Performante, that is to say being the fastest. The interior fittings are made from the highest quality materials: the seats are made of carbon fiber, the interior parts of Forged Composites®, and the upholstery is made from Alcantara. All extremely light materials which contribute to and increase performance.

            DRIVING DYNAMICS
        </h1>
        <p>
            There are many aspects that make this car the highest expression of the new concept of super sports car. The even more powerful V10 engine, massive use of Forged Composites® to make it even lighter in weight, the LDF 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the new ALA active aerodynamic system that controls air and directs it in its favor. It has ruled the circuit. Now it will rule your road.

            ENGINE
        </h1>
        <p>
            Totally renovated and redesigned with fluid dynamics optimized at both intake and exhaust, this engine is the aspirated V10 with the highest specific power. The new intake ducts come directly from Lamborghini Motorsport’s experience and improve response at all speeds. The double clutch transmission (LDF) has been further perfected and now is able to support even the highest performance. All this wrapped up in the even more vibrant and thrilling sound of the new lightened exhaust system.

            ALA
        </h1>
        <p>
            Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva is a smart and innovative system that manages active aerodynamics. ALA adapts to the driving style and type of route. When necessary, it increases vertical load to assist stability and speed through curves, or it reduces aerodynamic resistance to assist acceleration and reaching the top speed.

            SUSPENSION
        </h1>
        <p>
            The double wishbone architecture of the Huracán Performante's suspension systems guarantees perfect balance between usability of the vehicle and sports performance. The standard suspension is also teamed up with an optional system of magnetorheological shock absorbers that instantaneously respond to driving style and adapt to the road conditions and driving dynamics, improving control over the vehicle, especially on the circuit.
