        <p>
            The history of ‘Lamborghini Automobili’ officially starts in 1963. Nevertheless, we must consider the far-off roots of this event, and they are the roots of Ferruccio Lamborghini. Born in 1916, this capable, impetuous, strong-willed Taurus was the leading character in the foundation of the company and the early phases of its extraordinary history.

            Thus, by early 1965 the coupes from Sant’Agata were starting to be noticed. This was the first, great phase of the Lamborghini company, and one of its most prolific and creative periods. Between October 1965 and June 1966, the company presented an astonishing number of new models. Although cars like the 3500 GTZ (with a Zegato body), 350 Spyder by Touring and the Monza 400 by Neri and Bonacini were essentially prototypes, the seemingly extravagant chassis presented at the Lamborghini stand during the 1965 Turin Auto Show was destined to have a profound impact on the history of the company and on the entire automotive industry.

        <p>
            As a result, even a titled team like Lotus requested Lamborghini engines for the following season. Thanks also to this double supply of engines to two teams, the results for 1990 were nothing short of brilliant. At the end of the British Grand Prix, Bernard won an extraordinary fourth place and Suzuki placed sixth. The Hungarian Grand Prix was even more rewarding for the Lamborghini engines, which placed fifth, sixth and seventh, respectively with Warwick (Lotus), Bernard (Larrousse) and Donnelly (Lotus). Nevertheless, the best placement of the whole season came from Suzuki on his home turf at the Grand Prix in Japan, as he placed third and gave the company its first podium finish. This was the best placement ever achieved by a Lamborghini engine in all its seasons of activity.

        </h1>
        <p>
            The world premiere of the new HURACÁN LP 610-4 at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show opened a new era for Automobili Lamborghini and the entire segment of luxury super sports cars.

            In 2015, the Huracán series was expanded with several new, unmissable models: the Spyder, engineered to fend the air and merge with the sky, and the RWD, conceived and produced with a view to turn a technological vehicle into the purest example of “driving fun.”

            But 2015 was also the year of the Aventador, which saw two new breathtaking versions unveiled: the Aventador SV, developed as the Lamborghini with the sportiest DNA, and the Aventador SV Roadster, which combines high performance with the elegance and vanity of a Roadster.

            2016 is the year of the Huracán Avio, the special series inspired by aeronautics, but it is also the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the founder of the iconic car manufacturer. It’s in tribute to him that Lamborghini releases the Centenario, a true masterpiece of perfection: innovative design and excellent performance in a limited-edition super sports car that has already become the object of the desire for all the collectors.
