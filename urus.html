                    <p>
                        Lamborghini Urus has a cutting-edge, distinct and streamlined design with multiple souls: sporty, elegant and off-road. Its muscular surfaces make it appear strong and self-secure, while the mixed tires allow a luxury super sports car look. All the surfaces are designed with a clear attention to functionality. Some Lamborghini details and iconic shapes can be immediately recognized at first glance, such as the “Y” and the hexagon elements, the front bonnet with center peak and the cross lines on rear door. The extreme proportions and the single silhouette line make Urus a real Lamborghini. Furthermore, its proportions are unique since it is the lowest SUV  in its class. Urus design took inspiration from the heritage of the LM002 in regard to the power dome showing the position of the engine and the significant diagonal lines, while the frameless doors recall the iconic Marcello Gandini line.

                        In the Lamborghini Urus interior, luxurious Italian craftsmanship meets state-of-the-art technology.

The dashboard architecture follows the “Y” theme inspired by iconic Lamborghini models. The interior can be customized to be more elegant or more sporty, through the selection of different kinds of colors and materials, such as: natural leather, Alcantara®, wood finish, aluminum or carbon – with the option for further sophistication on select materials through contrast stitching or Q-citura. Urus features the largest range of options ever presented on a Lamborghini , with multiple souls converging to create a unique vehicle. Furthermore, Lamborghini Urus is the first five-seater super sports car.

                        What really makes Urus a true Lamborghini is the electronic platform that controls the systems and radically transforms its dynamic behavior, taking the driver experience to another level. The ANIMA Selector is the secret of Lamborghini driving dynamics, the key command to choose the desired setup. The vehicle adapts according to the driving mode selected. There are three on-road modes: STRADA for easiness of driving, comfort and safety; SPORT for agility, responsiveness and fun to drive; CORSA for precision and maximum performance. The three off-road modes enhance the Urus performance even more: NEVE ensures ease and safety even on slippery surfaces; TERRA ensures comfort and ease in off-road conditions; SABBIA is perfect for sandy surfaces. Finally, the EGO mode enables the driver to redefine the vehicle’s dynamics according to preferences and needs in terms of steering, suspension and traction.
